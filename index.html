    "In 1906, Santiago Ramón y Cajal and Camillo Golgi shared the Nobel Prize — despite fiercely opposing theories about how neurons were organized.",
    "Cajal's drawings of neurons are still considered some of the most accurate and beautiful scientific illustrations ever made.",
    "In 1791, Luigi Galvani discovered 'animal electricity' when a frog’s leg twitched after being touched by a metal scalpel.",
    "Hermann von Helmholtz was the first to measure the speed of nerve conduction in the 1840s — surprising everyone by showing it was far slower than electricity.",
    "Paul Broca identified the brain region for speech production in 1861 by studying patients with expressive aphasia.",
    "Karl Wernicke later identified a separate region for language comprehension, creating the foundation of classical language models.",
    "In 1937, James Papez proposed one of the first major theories of emotion, now known as the Papez circuit.",
    "The term 'synapse' was coined by Charles Sherrington in 1897 to describe the junction between neurons.",
    "In the 1950s, Hodgkin and Huxley used the giant squid axon to model the action potential — work that earned them the 1963 Nobel Prize.",
    "Wilder Penfield mapped the sensory and motor cortices using electrical stimulation during neurosurgery, producing the famous homunculus.",
    "The first EEG recording was made in 1924 by Hans Berger, who discovered the alpha rhythm.",
    "Phineas Gage’s 1848 accident became one of the first cases showing that specific brain regions control personality.",
    "Hubel and Wiesel’s 1959 cat experiments revealed the columnar organization of visual cortex and earned them the 1981 Nobel Prize.",
    "The neuron doctrine — that neurons are discrete cells — replaced the reticular theory thanks largely to Cajal’s work.",
    "The discovery of place cells by John O’Keefe in 1971 revolutionized our understanding of spatial memory.",
    "Eric Kandel’s studies of Aplysia in the 1960s uncovered the molecular basis of learning and memory.",
    "Roger Sperry's split-brain experiments in the 1960s demonstrated hemispheric specialization.",
    "Patricia Goldman-Rakic’s work in the 1970s established the prefrontal cortex as the center of working memory.",
    "Rita Levi-Montalcini discovered nerve growth factor during World War II and went on to win the 1986 Nobel Prize.",
    "In 1878, Richard Caton demonstrated electrical activity in the mammalian brain using crude electrodes.",
    "The discovery of neurotransmitters began with Otto Loewi’s 1921 frog heart experiment, which first showed chemical signaling between nerves.",
    "'Hebbian learning' — the idea that neurons that fire together wire together — was first proposed by Donald Hebb in 1949.",
    "In 1986, Masao Ito showed that the cerebellum plays a key role in motor learning through plasticity at Purkinje cell synapses.",
    "The concept of a 'connectome' originated in the 1970s but only gained traction after the complete mapping of C. elegans’ nervous system in 1986.",
    "Golgi’s silver staining technique, developed in 1873, allowed scientists to visualize individual neurons for the first time.",
    "In 1881, David Ferrier used electrical stimulation to map motor areas in primates, influencing the earliest neurosurgeries.",
    "In 1976, the discovery of endorphins revealed that the brain produces its own opiate-like chemicals.",
    "The first fMRI study was published in 1991, marking a major advance in noninvasive brain imaging.",
    "In 1935, Walter Freeman developed the transorbital lobotomy, a procedure later abandoned due to widespread ethical concerns.",
    "The term 'neuroplasticity' entered mainstream neuroscience only in the late 20th century, though early hints came from William James in 1890.",
    "The concept of critical periods in development was solidified by Hubel and Wiesel’s work on visual deprivation.",
    "In 1998, adult neurogenesis in the human hippocampus was proven by Jonas Frisén’s lab using carbon-dating techniques.",
    "Donald O. Hebb’s 1949 book 'The Organization of Behavior' is considered a founding text of cognitive neuroscience.",
    "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was first introduced in 1938 and remains one of the most effective treatments for severe depression.",
    "The idea of the 'triune brain' was proposed by Paul MacLean in the 1960s to describe evolutionary layers of brain organization.",
    "In 1973, Timothy Bliss and Terje Lømo discovered long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus.",
    "H.M.’s memory deficits, studied by Brenda Milner, provided the first clear evidence for multiple memory systems.",
    "The first brain-machine interface experiment was performed in 1969 by Eberhard Fetz, who trained a monkey to control a needle with neurons.",
    "In 2005, the Blue Brain Project began the effort to digitally simulate an entire mammalian brain."
